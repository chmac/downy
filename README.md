Coffeescript 503 down message

Server's crashing, mysql is freaking out, and you're working like made to get it back. You don't have time to put up a message telling users you'll be back.

```
git clone git@github.com:chmac/downy.git
cd downy
sudo coffee downy.coffee chmac
```

Substitute chmac for your own twitter username.

It's ugly but it works. Pull requests welcome.
